This is my final project. Welcome.

My plan is to make a sound project explaining how to play 'Landslide' by Fleetwood Mac on guitar. This will be accompanied by a visual made on GIMP. I might try to make it animated but we'll see. 
I might create a webpage to display the tutorial, unless I can find a different way to share it.
